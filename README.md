# City Explorer API - Persistence with a SQL database

# Project Name

**Author**: City Exploprer API - lab 08
**Version**: 1.0 (starting lab 08)

## Overview
This is an app for allowing someone to search weather conditions in any city.


## Getting Started

Steps to get started for lab-08

For this lab assignment, I will create a SQL database that the server will connect to in order to store and retrieve location information.

1. .env - with your PORT and API keys. Make sure this file is in your 
1. .gitignore so your keys are not pushed to GitHub.
1. README.md - with documentation regarding your lab and its current state of development. Check the “documentation” section below for more details on how that should look AT MINIMUM
1. .gitignore - with standard NodeJS configurations
1. .eslintrc.json - with Code 301 course standards for the linter
1. package.json - with all dependencies and any associated details related to configuration
1. schema.sql - file is added in this phase of the build

The configuration tree looks like this:

lab-08-repository
   ├── .env
   ├── .eslintrc.json
   ├── .gitignore
   ├── package-lock.json
   ├── package.json
   ├── schema.sql
   └── server.js

When completed site will be deployed to Heroku
