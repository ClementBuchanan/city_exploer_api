# Project Name: City Explorer API

**Author**: Clement Buchanan
**Version**: 1.0

## Overview

This is an app for allowing someone to search a city and get information on weather conditions, parks, movies and restaurants in that city. I will begin building an API server, which will provide data for the City Explorer Application, allowing a user to search for a location, present a Map, as well as interesting information about the area, all using data from APIs that your server will fetch and manage.

## Getting Started

1. **data directory** - with a location.json and a weather.jason file.
1. **.env** - with PORT 2021 number. This file is in the .gitignore so the keys will not be pushed to GitHub.
1. **README.md** - with documentation regarding your lab and its current state of development.
1. **.gitignore** - with standard NodeJS configurations
1. **.eslintrc.json** - with Code 301 course standards for the linter
1. **package.json** - with all dependencies and any associated details related to configuration. The dependencies needed for today’s lab include: express, cors, and dotenv.

Resources include:

1. Node JS Docs
1. NPM JS Docs
1. Express JS Docs
1. dotenv Docs

## Steps to get started

__Configuration__

1. .env - with your PORT and API keys. Make sure this file is in your
1. .gitignore so your keys are not pushed to GitHub.
1. README.md - with documentation regarding lab and its current state of development.
1. .gitignore - with standard NodeJS configurations
1. .eslintrc.json - with Code 301 course standards for the linter
1. package.json - with all dependencies and any associated details related to configuration
1. schema.sql - file is added in this phase of the build

The configuration tree looks like this:

lab-06-repository
├── data
   |     ├── weather.json
   |     └── location.json
   ├── .env
   ├── .eslintrc.json
   ├── .gitignore
   ├── package-lock.json
   ├── package.json
   └── server.js

## Architecture

Built with javascript and jQuery on a SQL db. Hosted on Heroku server. The application will use Express and jQuery libraries. On the front-end the user will enter their request and the app will display information based on the city requested.
