# Lab 06: Comments

This took me a very long time to complete due to a lack of understand how to do it. After asking Nicholas forsome clafification during class I was able to grasp it better allowing me to complete this section. I did a code review with Brendan Smith on his code after drawing the WRRC and I was able to understand it even more.
