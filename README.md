# Project Name

**Author**: City Exploprer API - lab 08
**Version**: 1.4 (starting lab 08)

## Overview
<!-- Provide a high level overview of what this application is and why you are building it, beyond the fact that it's an assignment for this class. (i.e. What's your problem domain?) --> This is an app for allowing someone to search weather conditions in any city.

## Getting Started
<!-- What are the steps that a user must take in order to build this app on their own machine and get it running? -->

Steps to get started:

### For all labs

1. .env - with your PORT and API keys. Make sure this file is in your 
1. .gitignore so your keys are not pushed to GitHub.
1. README.md - with documentation regarding your lab and its current state of development. Check the “documentation” section below for more details on how that should look AT MINIMUM
1. .gitignore - with standard NodeJS configurations
1. .eslintrc.json - with Code 301 course standards for the linter
1. package.json - with all dependencies and any associated details related to configuration

__For lab 06__ 

__For lab 07__ 

__For lab 08__ Getting APIs from these resources:
1. Superagent Docs
1. Location IQ Geocoding API - Specifically, the “Search Forward/GeoCoding” section
1. Weather Bit API Doc


## Architecture
<!-- Provide a detailed description of the application design. What technologies (languages, libraries, etc) you're using, and any other relevant design information. -->
Built with javascript and jQuery with a SQL database and hosted on Heroku server.

## Change Log
<!-- Use this area to document the iterative changes made to your application as each feature is successfully implemented. Use time stamps. Here's an examples:

01-01-2001 4:59pm - Application now has a fully-functional express server, with a GET route for the location resource.

## Credits and Collaborations
<!-- Give credit (and a link) to other people or resources that helped you build this application. -->
01-17-21 2:30pm started with some starter code

# Lab 06: Comments

This took me a very long time to complete due to a lack of understand how to do it. After asking Nicholas forsome clafification during class I was able to grasp it better allowing me to complete this section. I did a code review with Brendan Smith on his code after drawing the WRRC and I was able to understand it even more. I finally got this lab comleted 0n 1/20/21 at 7:00pm. Moving on to lab 07.
