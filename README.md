# City Explorer API

# Project Name: City Explorer API

**Author**: Clement Buchanan
**Version**: 1.0

## Overview

This is an app that will allow someone to check on the weather condition in any city. For this lab assignment, I will use the latitude and longitude to request information about movies related to the area, yelp info, and events near the location.

I will also be using modularization and functional programming principles to refactor and modularize this application for readability

## Getting Started


## Steps to get started

__Configuration__

1. .env - with your PORT and API keys. Make sure this file is in your
1. .gitignore so your keys are not pushed to GitHub.
1. README.md - with documentation regarding lab and its current state of development.
1. .gitignore - with standard NodeJS configurations
1. .eslintrc.json - with Code 301 course standards for the linter
1. package.json - with all dependencies and any associated details related to configuration
1. schema.sql - file is added in this phase of the build

The configuration tree looks like this:

lab-08-repository
   ├── .env
   ├── .eslintrc.json
   ├── .gitignore
   ├── package-lock.json
   ├── package.json
   ├── schema.sql
   └── server.js

__Getting APIs form these resources:__

* SQL Syntax Cheatsheet
* PostgreSQL Shell Cheatsheet
* PostgreSQL Docs
* Yelp API Docs
* The Movie DB API Docs
* National Park Service API Docs


### For lab-09

For lab-09 a schema.sql file must be added to the data folder. The file tree should look like this:

 lab-09-repository
   ├── data
   |    └── schema.sql
   ├── .env
   ├── .eslintrc.json
   ├── .gitignore
   ├── package-lock.json
   ├── package.json
   └── server.js
   ├── modules
   |    └── location.js
   |    └── weather.js 

## Architecture

Built with javascript and jQuery on a SQL db. Hosted on Heroku server. On the front-end the user will enter their request and the app will display information based on the city requested.
